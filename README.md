# **Campaign Outcomes Analysis**

## Overview of Project

Louise's play *Fever* came close to its fundraising goal during a short period of time. Louise has asked us to show her how other campaigns have done compared to hers. 
The following analysis shows the outcomes of comparable campaigns based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
